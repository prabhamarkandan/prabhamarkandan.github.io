## About This Series


**This is Part 1 of a two-part series on engineering debt in the age of AI.**  

The conversation around engineering debt usually centers on code quality and refactoring. But in practice, debt takes many forms - messy code, outdated tools, clunky workflows, and even deeper team and ownership issues.

Imagine your engineering organization as a grand old building. You might spot a few cracks in the walls - fragile code, legacy systems, manual release processes - and teams might debate how urgent the repairs are, scramble for funding, or argue over whose responsibility it is to fix them. But sometimes, the real problem is deeper and more structural: the very foundation weakened, not just by technical shortcuts and process pain, but by years of shifting roles, unclear ownership, and blurred accountability.

This is the hidden crisis facing teams moving from project to product. If you don’t spot and fix the full spectrum of engineering debt - technical, process, and organizational - even the best AI-powered features will be built on shaky ground. In the age of AI, these weaknesses are exposed faster and more brutally than ever before.

In this two-part series, you’ll get practical strategies and real-world examples - from Twitter to Netflix and Etsy - to help you:
 
 - Spot the hidden cracks (technical, process, and organizational debt) slowing your delivery
 - Diagnose the real root causes, not just the symptoms
 - Build a resilient, accountable engineering foundation for sustainable, fast-moving innovation
 
- **Part 1** dives deep into how to spot the warning signs and shine a light on the cracks.
- **Part 2** will show you how to fix them for good.

If you want your AI-powered features to deliver real value - not just demos or prototypes - this series is your roadmap.

## The Hidden Threat: How to Spot the Engineering Debt Slowing Your AI Feature Rollouts

Across engineering, product, and delivery teams, the pressure to move faster has never been greater. With AI-powered coding assistants and AI technologies accelerating feature development, the gap between rapid delivery and sustainable, reliable systems is wider - and riskier - than ever before.

But what if the biggest thing slowing you down isn’t the AI technology itself, but the hidden engineering debt quietly sabotaging your efforts?

Drawing on respected sources like the *DevOps Handbook*, Martin Fowler’s technical debt quadrants, and my own two decades in engineering, I’ve found it useful to think of engineering debt as three interlinked categories: **technical**, **process**, and **organizational**. Understanding which one is your biggest bottleneck is essential to prioritizing your cleanup efforts - especially when resources are tight.

Engineering debt isn’t just a technical problem; it’s a complex mix of code shortcuts, broken processes, and misaligned teams that accumulate over time. And it can cripple organizations of *any size* - from startups to giants.

This article is for you - the leader who needs clarity on:

- **What exactly is engineering debt - beyond just “bad code”?**
- **How to recognize the most urgent problem slowing your delivery?**
- **How to prioritize fixes that will have the biggest impact, fast?**

And if you’re an engineer facing these challenges firsthand, you’ll learn:

- **How to identify debt in your day-to-day work**
- **How to raise these issues effectively with leadership - turning your insights into action that moves the needle**

Together, we’ll uncover the hidden saboteurs slowing your AI ambitions and explore practical ways to reclaim control.

Because in today’s AI-driven world, building on a shaky foundation won’t just slow you down - it will cause costly outages, lost customers, and frustrated teams.

When Twitter faced a string of major outages in 2022, it wasn’t just bad luck or a few buggy features. Behind the scenes, years of accumulated engineering debt - technical shortcuts, patchy processes, and organizational misalignment - had built up like rust on the engine.

This hidden debt left their system brittle, turning rapid growth into repeated firefighting. The constant firefighting drained resources and slowed innovation, illustrating how hidden debt can paralyze even the most high-profile platforms.

- [X continues to suffer bugs following Thursday outage - TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/23/x-continues-to-suffer-bugs-following-thursday-outage/)

It’s a story many tech leaders know too well: moving fast without fixing the cracks first can bring your whole product to its knees.

## Where to Start When Everything Feels Broken

When your engineering ship feels like it’s taking on water, it’s tempting to throw everything at the problem. But without focus, you risk sinking faster.

**The first step? Understand *where* the debt lives.**

Here’s a quick test:

- If you can fix it without changing how teams or workflows are structured -> **Technical debt**
- If the work is slow because the steps, tools, or approvals take too long -> **Process debt**
- If the biggest blocker is *who* owns the work or *how* teams are structured -> **Organizational debt**

Engineering debt hides in three key places, each with distinct causes and consequences:

### 1. Technical Debt – Fragile, Tangled Codebases and Outdated Architectures

This is the classic "technical debt" as originally popularized by Ward Cunningham and later clarified by Martin Fowler. It lives inside the codebase or tech stack and covers:

- Code quality issues (messy, brittle code)
- Outdated or poorly designed architecture
- Quick hacks or shortcuts that need refactoring
- Legacy systems that are hard to maintain or extend
- Lack of automated tests or fragile test suites

**Example:** Netflix’s microservices sprawl became so complex their teams invested heavily in chaos engineering - intentionally breaking parts of their system to build resilience and combat hidden technical debt.

- [Microservices Retrospective from Netflix - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-netflix-industry/)

### 2. Process Debt – Inefficient, Fragile, or Manual Workflows

Process debt arises when your delivery workflows are bogged down by slow, manual deployment steps, painful release processes, or approval gates that add delay without clear value. Common signs include:

- Long, manual deployment steps
- Painful release processes
- Approval gates that add delay without value
- No CI/CD pipelines or unreliable automation

**Example:** Etsy moved from monthly or weekly releases to continuous deployment, releasing dozens of times a day - a cultural revolution that turned process debt into a competitive advantage.

- [Etsy’s Journey to Continuous Integration for Mobile Apps](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/etsys-journey-to-continuous-integration-for-mobile-apps?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

While continuous deployment focuses on improving workflows (process debt), it requires addressing underlying technical debt - like automated tests and reliable pipelines - to enable safe, rapid releases. So, reducing process debt often involves fixing some technical debt along the way.

### 3. Organizational Debt – Poor Communication, Unclear Roles, and Misaligned Teams

The most subtle, and often the most crippling - the human and structural issues that slow teams down:

- Poor communication or misalignment between teams
- Unclear roles and responsibilities
- Lack of decision ownership
- Organizational silos
- Dysfunctional team dynamics
- Inadequate leadership support or direction

**Example:** Sometimes the blocker isn’t doing the upgrade - it’s figuring out *who’s responsible* for doing the upgrade. If your team spends more time chasing ownership than fixing the issue, you’re facing organizational debt.

Spotify’s ‘squad’ model was designed to break down these silos, empowering small, autonomous teams with clear ownership to accelerate delivery and innovation.

#### Organizational Debt: The Foundation You Can’t Ignore

Much has been written about technical debt, but organizational debt is the debt you *owe* your organization to fix - because without it, technical and process improvements won’t stick.

**You can’t refactor your way out of a bad org chart.**

If ownership and accountability are unclear, no amount of cleaner code or automated tests will save you - because no one will feel responsible for maintaining them.

By tackling organizational debt first, leaders create the environment where teams are motivated and empowered to address technical and process debt effectively.

*Remember:* What looks like a technical problem often hides an ownership problem. Fix the foundation first, and everything else follows.

## For Engineers Grappling with Engineering Debt

If you’re an engineer experiencing these challenges firsthand, start by identifying which category your blocker belongs to.

When you raise concerns, frame them in terms leadership understands:

- **Delivery risks**
- **Customer impact**
- **Business outcomes**
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**

Be clear, evidence-driven, and constructive - this gives your voice more weight and opens doors for change.

**Make ROI part of your case:**  
Leadership is often persuaded by the tangible return on investment for tackling engineering debt. Try to quantify how fixing the debt will:

- Reduce time spent firefighting or fixing bugs (freeing up resources for new features)
- Lower operational costs (for example, by improving system efficiency or reducing cloud spend)
- Improve customer satisfaction (leading to higher retention or new business)
- Enable faster, safer releases (translating to greater business agility and competitiveness)

The more you can show how tackling debt pays off—whether in dollars saved, time gained, or customer value delivered—the more likely leadership will listen and act.

> Not all engineering debt is accidental. Sometimes teams take on intentional debt to move fast, trading short-term speed for long-term cost. This can be a strategic decision - but only if there’s a clear plan to pay it back.
>
> Viewing engineering debt this way empowers leaders to balance speed and quality without fear, treating debt as a tool, not a trap.

### Key Alarms That Should Make You Hit the Brakes

If your engineering feels like this, it’s a red flag that debt is slowing you down - don’t wait for collapse:

- Deployments regularly fail or require firefighting.
- Onboarding new engineers takes forever due to confusing code or missing docs.
- Cloud or operational costs climb without clear reasons.
- Features take longer than planned; user complaints rise.
- Decision-making stalls as teams wait for approvals or info.
- Communication breakdowns cause duplicated work or mistakes.
- Recurring bugs or outages affect user experience.

If you spot two or more, it’s time to dig deeper.

## Spot Your Biggest Problem: A Practical Guide

Start by gathering evidence of where the pain points are. Look for your loudest alarms - these symptoms reveal the kind of debt slowing you down:

| Symptom                       | Likely Debt Type      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Frequent bugs, brittle code   | Technical Debt       |
| Manual workflows, slow pipelines | Process Debt      |
| Miscommunication, unclear ownership | Organizational Debt |

Then prioritize what to fix based on impact, feasibility, and potential ROI:

- What hurts customers or business most?
- What’s fixable with your current resources?
- Where can you score a quick win to boost morale or show a strong return?

Start small, track progress, and build momentum - each win chips away at your debt and frees your team.

**Pro Tip: Apply the Pareto Principle**

Often, about 20% of your engineering debt causes 80% of the problems slowing delivery. By identifying and tackling that critical 20%, you unlock disproportionate improvements fast - making the cleanup effort more effective and motivating your team with visible wins.

Sometimes the boundaries blur. For example:

- A missing or poorly defined deployment pipeline could be *process debt*, but if it’s caused by an outdated platform or tool that’s hard to maintain, it can also be *technical debt*.
- Poor communication might cause process delays but is really *organizational debt*.

Ultimately, use these categories as practical guides to identify and fix problems - not to get stuck on exact labels.

## How to Make the Hidden Visible: Tools That Help You Spot Engineering Debt Early

> One of the biggest challenges with engineering debt is that it often hides in plain sight - slowly eroding your systems and processes without obvious warning signs.
>
> **You can’t fix what you don’t see - and that’s where tools become your eyes in the dark.**
>
> *Data doesn’t lie. Let it be your early warning system.*

Successful organizations don’t rely on gut feelings alone. They invest in tooling and monitoring to surface hidden problems early, giving them time to act before small issues turn into costly disasters.

These tools generate measurable signals - like warning lights on a car dashboard - that help teams and leaders understand where the real pain points are, whether in code quality, deployment reliability, cloud costs, or team dynamics.

### Tools to Make Engineering Debt Visible

- **Deployment and pipeline monitoring tools** (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI) flag frequent failures.
- **Code quality and test coverage tools** (e.g., SonarQube) highlight risky areas.
- **Cloud cost monitoring tools** (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer) uncover inefficiencies.
- **Observability platforms** (e.g., Datadog) provide system health insights.
- **Team health surveys and retrospectives** reveal organizational blockers.

## Why This Matters for Your AI Ambitions

*As you add AI-powered features, you’re building on complex layers that demand agility and reliability. If your foundation is shaky, AI won’t speed you up - it will expose weaknesses and slow you down.*

**AI isn’t magic - it’s a magnifier. It speeds up your good practices and amplifies your mistakes. A turbocharger only works if your engine doesn’t blow up.**

---

## Where Does AI Fit in Tackling Engineering Debt?

Think of AI as a highly skilled but impatient junior developer - producing code fast but without full awareness of reliability, scalability, or security needs.

That’s where seasoned engineers bring judgment and experience, bridging the gap between rapid AI-generated code and stable production systems.

The tools and practices for detecting technical, process, and organizational debt matter now more than ever.

AI is becoming your watchful assistant, able to:

- Review code in real time, flagging risky patterns before production breaks.
- Monitor deployment pipelines to alert you to trouble early.
- Generate and prioritize tests to keep your codebase healthy without extra manual effort.
- Analyze incidents rapidly to find root causes.
- Spot workflow and communication bottlenecks slowing your team.

But AI is a turbocharger, not a steering wheel. Skilled engineers and strong leadership still drive the cleanup.
