Hi, I’m Prabha Markandan. 

After a long break, I’m excited to start sharing again - this time on engineering, AI, coding experiments, and reflections on engineering leadership, growth, and identity.

This will be my space to capture what I’m learning, building, and thinking about. 

Whether you’re building, leading, learning, or just curious, I hope you’ll find ideas here that spark inspiration or offer something useful for your own journey.

Stay tuned for stories, experiments, and insights ahead.
