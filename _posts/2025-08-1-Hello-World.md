Hi, I'm Prabha Markandan. After a long break, I feel compelled to share my thoughts again! This time, on all things engineering, my AI learnings, coding experiments, and anything interesting around identity, leadership, and beyond.

This space is where I’ll jot down what I’m learning, tinkering with, and reflecting on. 
Whether you’re a fellow engineer, leader, coder, or just curious, I hope you find something here that sparks your interest or helps you along your journey.

Stay tuned for stories, experiments, and insights!
