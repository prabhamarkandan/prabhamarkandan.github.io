I’m Prabha Markandan, an engineering and delivery leader with two decades of experience across tech, banking, finance, and insurance. 
I began as a full-stack engineer, and that hands-on experience continues to inform how I support teams, shape platforms, and deliver meaningful outcomes, all while having the privilege of learning from every project and every person I work with.

Over the years, I’ve enjoyed leading digital transformation initiatives, helping distributed teams grow, improving operational health, and contributing to platform strategy and engineering practices - always with a focus on enabling teams to deliver effectively and with impact.

I love writing about engineering leadership, delivery excellence, technology strategy, and the evolving role of AI in how we build and solve problems. I’m fascinated by Generative AI, LLMs, and Agentic AI, and how we can guide them responsibly, ethically, and in ways that contribute to a more equitable world.

I also enjoy reading about history and connecting the dots between past events and today’s economy - it gives me perspective on how the world shapes us and the choices we make.

As a leadership coach (ICF-accredited, in progress), I’ve been working on myself and helping others to overcome limiting beliefs, build confidence, develop their leadership potential, and achieve meaningful impact. 

I believe life’s work is about learning, growing, and living our best lives - while helping others do the same.
