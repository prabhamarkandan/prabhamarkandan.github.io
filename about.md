I'm Prabha Markandan, a software engineer turned engineering leader with two decades of experience across tech, banking, finance, and insurance.

I began my career as a full-stack engineer, and that hands-on experience continues to shape how I lead teams, evolve platforms, and deliver systems with purpose. Over the years, I've led digital transformation initiatives, scaled distributed teams, improved operational health, and shaped platform strategy and engineering practices to help teams deliver faster, with quality and impact.

My writing explores engineering leadership, delivery excellence, platform strategy, and the evolving role of AI in how we build and solve problems. I'm fascinated by how breakthroughs in Generative AI, LLMs, and Agentic AI are transforming software engineering, automating workflows, and reshaping the global economy. I'm deeply curious about how we can guide AI responsibly, ethically, and for societal benefit.

I'm also a leadership coach, helping emerging leaders grow with confidence, build high-performing engineering teams, and shape strategy effectively. Beyond tech and leadership, I love exploring history, AI, and technology, sharing insights through writing, and connecting with people to inspire learning and meaningful impact.

If you're curious about coaching or just want to connect, I'd love to hear from you.
